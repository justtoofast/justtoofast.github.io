What do dog training and object orientation programming(OOP) have in common? How do you go about teaching dogs complex behaviors?


When you're talking about objects in OOP, you're defining what each object is, what it does, and how it relates or communicates to other objects. 
When you begin to teach a complex behavior/command to a dog, you want to break it down into smaller individual behaviors, train those behaviors separately, then bring it together at the end.

Think about teaching a dog how to come to focused heel on your left side. Which is from anywhere your dog may be when you call them to heel, come to the left side of your body, sit down, and look up at you with your eyes meeting. No way you're going to be able to do it all in one training session! 

If you can imagine trying to code this behavior to a class FocusedHeel and try to define it, you find out that in order to focus heel, you need to have known how to Sit, how to make Eye Contact, and Come to the correct side of the body. Imagine all of these behaviors are classes too!

Once you have engagement with your dog, anything is possible:

Train your dog to sit
Train your dog to look at you in the eye on cue
Train your dog to come to your left side

These all need to be taught separately, with multiple 15-minute sessions for each behavior on different days. Now try imagining coding these into classes, you learn that in order to FocusedHeel, you need to have all of these classes interact with each other maybe through a has many relationship. Because even though you have 4 different behaviors trained, to create a focused heel you still need to:

Train your dog to come to your left side AND sit
Train your dog to come to your left side AND look at you
Train your dog to come to your left side AND sit AND look at you


In conclusion, there are many similarities in dog training and oject oriented programming, with abstraction being a big key to both, but it doesn't take years to train a program!
