Software, programming, coding, all relative terms to the community here at Flatiron. To me, everything meant the same, a means to an end. When I first started learning about computer programming, my first thought was, "I'm a techie, this sounds like something I can do for a living.". I researched salaries for software engineering positions and decided that this was going to be the occupation I will have for the rest of my life. So I enrolled into my local state university for their 4-year Software Engineering program, where I first got my feet dipped into learning the fundamentals of programming. Never once did I venture out and think about the impact that I can make on the world through programming. For me, I was just trying to get a degree and work for the rest of my life.

I had no real goals or ambitions. This caused me to lose motivation in school and I got placed on academic probation for failing my Calculus course. Soon after that, I dropped out of school. However, I was still interested in coding, but there was no meaning to it for me. I began a YouTube binge, watching real programmers talk about why they got into programming. Some got interested because they had an awesome idea that they wanted to build and create, some were just taught from an early age and stuck with it, and some were just trying to score a job. But they all had something in common, drive and motivation. 

Lacking both drive and motivation, it was hard for me to continuing my education in coding. Then one day, I overheard a conversation between my cousin and his friend (whom are both programmers). They were talking about their jobs and databases and all this stuff I never heard of. Then it occured to me, programming is a skillset. I called myself a techie, but all I knew was basic networking, basic computer hardware, etc. I never mastered anything. 

I have always wanted a skillset that I could talk about, or have high-level conversations to someone about a topic that sounds gibberish to your layman. I began to realize that if I learned how to code, I would have the tools needed to make an impact technology. The drive and motivation came soon after and here I am working my way through the Web Dev program.
